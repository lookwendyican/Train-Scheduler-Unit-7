# Train-Scheduler-Unit-7
Creating a train schedule website using ajax, APIs and firebase to store data to the server

This app provides up-to-date information about various trains, such as their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.  It retrieves and manipulates the data with Moment.js.
